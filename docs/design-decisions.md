# Design Decisions
Certain colors where choosen based on the wimsicle, childish, and playful intention. Some of the colors are purely secondary and suppor colors. These colors are characterize in a way that brings contrast to the overall design. Some of the colors are a pale version of the primary cilors. In association with the monogram the colors each shade of primary is assigned white lettering aside from the primary orange which is a primary contrast color which the letter is asigned a light orange. Same ordeal for the secondary colors which are assigned whit lettering and orange a lighter orange. the many shades of white and light grey's are assigned a darker color for the letter. wether that's black or a dark grey that helps contrast the monogram. 

on to the components, we drew inspiration from the free figma community and the digital success of a franchise level daycare center. Some of our components are mirror images of the main source due to the level of professionalism and success that we wo=ant to achive and have also our parents feel. In example, our footer demonstraights the idea of the main source giving a visitor many options and decisions to fill out the experience of using our site to gain resources, navigate and contact professionals. 

some of the components are drawn from the many free resiurces rthat are displayed on the figma community. Even though these resources are deigned for a certian setting the wireframes are mimic and catered to the child care indusrty. these components lacked the idea of parent engagement which we had to induce a level of creativity to pull forward in a way that directs parents to schedule a tour and gain an experience of learning to better be a parent from our parent resources.
