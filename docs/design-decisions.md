# Design Decisions
Certain colors were chosen to reflect a whimsical, childlike, and playful intention. Some colors serve purely as secondary or supporting tones. These colors are characterized in a way that brings contrast and balance to the overall design. A few are pale versions of the primary colors, helping to create a soft visual hierarchy.

In association with the monogram, each shade of the primary palette is paired with white lettering—except for the primary orange, which is treated as a contrast color. In that case, the monogram is assigned a light orange tone. The same principle applies to secondary colors, which are typically assigned white lettering, with the exception of orange tones, where a lighter orange is used instead. The various shades of white and light grays are paired with dark lettering—either black or dark gray—to maintain legibility and contrast within the monogram.

As for the components, we drew inspiration from the free Figma Community as well as from the digital presence of successful, franchise-level daycare centers. Some of our components are direct mirrors of those sources, reflecting the level of professionalism and trust we aim to achieve—and want our parents to feel. For example, our footer demonstrates the philosophy of the main source, providing visitors with multiple options and touchpoints to enhance the experience—whether that's accessing resources, navigating the site, or contacting professionals.

Several components were also adapted from free Figma community resources. While many of these designs were created for different industries, we customized the wireframes to fit the childcare space. These original components often lacked elements of parent engagement, so we infused them with our own creative solutions to guide parents toward key actions—such as scheduling a tour—and offer them tools and resources to grow in their parenting journey.
